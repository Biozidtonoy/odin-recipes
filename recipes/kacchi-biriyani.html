    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="Description">
        Biryani is a mixed rice dish, mainly popular in South Asia. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef, prawn, or fish) and spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables or paneer for the meat. Sometimes eggs or potatoes are also added.

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p class="notes">
        Mutton can be substituted with lamb or beef, which will give a slightly different taste.
        It’s best to use a cooking pot that has a tightly fitted lid.
        The easiest way to grind spices is to use a coffee grinder.
        When I first started cooking Kachchi biryani, I marinated the meat overnight. I have cooked it with 30 minutes of
        marinating with almost the same tenderness. Use your judgment depending on the meat quality and the time you have in
        hand.
        Condensed milk can be substituted by sprinkling ½ cup of milk to the biryani layers and adding 2 tablespoon of sugar to
        the fried golden onion.
        I use a 160ml cup that comes with standard rice cookers in the USA to measure rice. Adjust your rice measurementaccordingly.
